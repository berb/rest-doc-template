=================

> A template for creating human readable RESTful API documentations.

Introduction
------------
This tool facilitates the creation of high-quality and comprehensive documentations of RESTful APIs for humans. Therefore it provides a simple XML schema for describing the API, its resources and operations. 
The documentation can be rendered into various formats, like plain text, XHTML and PDF (using LaTeX). 

Requirements
------------
### Required

- Apache Ant (Available for all common OSs)
- Java JDK 

### Optional
To generate pdf output pdftex is required, some additional fonts and formatting packages are also required.

Using Ubuntu / Debian this requires the following packages to be installed:

- texlive-latex-base
- texlive-latex-extra
- texlive-fonts-recommended

On Windows the quickest way to get LaTeX working is using the MikTeX distribution from http://miktex.org/

Usage
-----------
This tool provides an Ant build file for executing transformations. The following targets are available so far:

- plain
- xhtml
- pdf
- all

The following command generates a PDF version from the XML file expected in the directory foo named bla.xml

> ant pdf -Dapidir=foo -Dapiname=bla

If successful, the PDF file can be found in output/foo/bla.pdf

You can also set the $api variable in the build-file and omit the parameter.


Available Stylesheets
------------
- XHTML (work in progress)
- text/plain (in progress)
- LaTeX (in progress)


Examples
-----------
Please have a look at `example/example.xml` and the corresponding output files at `output/example/`. 

FAQ
---

> Why XML?

Because it's nice for these purposes. The schema definition allows guided documentation through auto-completion and XSL is a good start for transformations into other formats. 


> Why not WADL?

Although both formats have some descriptions in common, WADL tends to be a machine-readable description that helps generating code.
My template instead facilitates the creation of APIs for human readers and will thus not be an appropriate source for any kind of stub generation.


> But a truly RESTful API does not need a documentation except mentioning the initial end-point URI! So why?

Even if your API is so RESTful that you are confident of needing no external documentation, it is still nice to have one for yourself, right?
Furthermore, most client-side developers will still be happy to grab a copy anyway.
